# Data-Visualisation--Breast-cancer-dataset

This is my second Kaggle practice and I am working on the (breast cancer datase)[https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data]. This dataset caught my attention as it is one of the top dataset used to test machine models catered to predict malignant and benign tumours. 
- For this practice, I did the usual exploratory data analysis and the objective was to find the correlation between each variable (radius, texture, area, perimeter, compactness, concavity, etc) and whether that has any effect on determining if the tumour is malignant or benign.
