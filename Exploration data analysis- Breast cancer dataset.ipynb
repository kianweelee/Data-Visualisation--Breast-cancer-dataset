Although numerous imaging techniques have been put in place for the diagnostic and treatment of breast cancer, the advancement in genetic programming and machine learning over the past decades have improved the accuracy of breast cancer detection tremendously, more so than imaging techniques. To facilitate interpretation and analysis, enormous amount of mammography films have been processed by the system to help improve the visibility of peripheral areas and intensity distribution, and several methods have been reported to assist in this process. Feature extraction is one of the most important step in breast cancer detection due to its ability to differentiate between benign and malignant tumors. After extraction, image properties such as smoothness, coarseness, depth, and regularity are extracted by segmentation.\n\nThis dataset is ideal for the testing of machine learning model but since I have just started out (this is my second Kaggle), I will be merely performing an exploration data analysis. \n\n## Objective\n- Find out the correlation between cancer radius, texture,parimeter, compactness, etc and whether the cancer is malignant or benign. \n- Upon finding out their correlation, find the relationship between these variables and whether the cancer is malignant or benign.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First step is to import the required packages.
